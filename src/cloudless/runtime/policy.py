"""Q19 portable governance: @cloudless.policy decorator + stage hooks.

A *policy* is a callable invoked at well-known stages of agent execution:

    before_llm   — receives `prompt: str`, may return modified prompt or raise PolicyViolation
    after_llm    — receives `prompt: str, response: str`, may return modified response
    before_tool  — receives `tool_name: str, args: dict`, may return modified args
    after_tool   — receives `tool_name: str, args: dict, result: Any`, may return modified result
    before_peer  — receives `peer: str, prompt: str`, may return modified prompt
    after_peer   — receives `peer: str, prompt: str, response: str`, may return modified response

Policies run in registration order. Each stage's pipeline short-circuits if any
policy raises `PolicyViolation` (or `GuardrailBlocked`).

Cloud-portable design rationale:
  - Bedrock Guardrails + Gemini Safety Filters are cloud-native. cloudless
    policies sit ABOVE those (Python-level redaction, custom block lists,
    org-specific rules) and run in the embedded runtime regardless of cloud.
  - For an audit story (Q19), every policy invocation is recorded on
    ctx.audit_log if a policy raises.

Usage:

    @cloudless.policy(stages=["before_llm"])
    def block_ssn(stage, prompt, **kw):
        if SSN_REGEX.search(prompt):
            raise cloudless.PolicyViolation("SSN detected")
        return prompt   # could also transform

    @cloudless.policy(stages=["after_llm"], priority=10)
    def redact_emails(stage, prompt, response, **kw):
        return EMAIL_REGEX.sub("<email>", response)
